## Installation

#### Via Toltec

The recommended way of installing the software in this repository is to use
[toltec](https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec) - a free software repository for
remarkable. Once opkg and the toltec repository are setup, use `opkg install
remux` to get remux, for example.


If you are feeling adventurous, you can try out the bootstrap script from
linusCDE that installs opkg, toltec and the rmkit packages in one line: `wget -qO-
https://rmkit.dev/bs | sh -C harmony minesweeper remux nao`

#### Build Server

Binaries are generated on every push to this git repository and are hosted at
https://build.rmkit.dev

#### Try it out

run `wget -O- https://rmkit.dev/try.sh -q | sh -` on the remarkable via SSH

To exit harmony, press the power button to bring up the exit dialog.

#### Install

run `wget -O- https://rmkit.dev/install.sh -q | sh -` to install the remux app launcher until the next time the device is updated

to launch remux and switch between apps, hold the center button for 2+ seconds.

#### Uninstalling

to remove remux, run `systemctl disable remux --now`. All the applications are
installed into /home/root/apps with the above `install.sh` script, so you can
delete that directory safely.
